## Regular Expressions

They are not unique to java 

A regular expression is a pattern that can be matched against a string. It's about pattern matching.

```java
import java.util.regex.*;

// Pattern
// Matcher

```

Constants\
Match exactly the string inside the regex 

Character classes \
match any character inside [ ]

Predefined character classes \
```java
. any character
\d a digit
\D a non digit
\s
\S
\w
\W
```

[0-9] is same as \d

Quatifiers
``` java
X? //going from left to right from string and match once or not at all
x* //0 or more times
X+ //one or more times
X{n}
X{n,}
X{n,m}

```
\d{9} matches 9 digits

^ = beginning of regex  
$ = end
