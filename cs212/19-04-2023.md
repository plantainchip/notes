## Maps

A map is a collection of key/values pairs

Hashmap gives a table of info that was subscripted by indices and keys and values
 working with hashmaps
hashMap.keySet().iterator


Class TreeMap
to create a treemap it is concerned about where to put data into treemap so its in an appropriate place where sorting can be easy

Comparator object
The compare method is the one that will decide which one is smaller
You have to make a new class for the comparator

The TreeMap is efficient becasue it keeps items in order

The TreeMap is based on the Red-Black Tree
