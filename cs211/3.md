# 8 Numbers In A Cross Problem

```c++

  [][]       0 1
[][][][]   2 3 4 5
  [][]       6 7


[][][][][][][][]
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
this is what the program sees 

the numbers is from 1 - 8
```

**ok function**\
This ok function uses a helper array
```c++
static int helper[8][5] = { // Helper Array
  {-1}, // 0
  {0,-1}, // 1
  {0,-1}, // 2
  {0,1,2,-1}, // 3
  {0,1,3,-1}, // 4
  {1,4,-1}, // 5
  {2,3,4,-1}, // 6
  {3,4,5,6,-1} // 7
};
```

the ok functions does 2 checks:
- check if the numer in position c (current position) has already been used
- check if the numbers are consecutive

```c++
//check if the number in position c has already been used
for(int i = 0; i < c; i++){
  if(q[c]==q[i]) return false;
}
//check if numbers are consecutive
for(int i = 0; helper[c][i] != -1; i++){
  if(abs(q[c]-q[helper[c][i]]) == 1) return false;
}
```

if all the checks were passed then return true

**print function** \
prints

**main function** \
Create the 1d array for the sequence\
initialize square / index (c) = 0 \
places number 1 at position 0 q[c] = 0


Outer while loop that ends if col isn't >= 0 anymore. \
  if col reaches 8 then print the solution and backtrack (decrement c) \
  else go to a new square (increment c) and make num = 0

  Inner while loop that ends if square isn't >= 0 anymore \
    move to the next num by incrementing  q[c] \
    if the num reaches 9 meaning if no num can be placed on that square then backtrack (decrement c) \
    else if there is no conflicts (call the ok function on your array) 
    then move to the next square and break out of the inner while loop and go to the outer while loop.
