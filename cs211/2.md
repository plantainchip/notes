# Eight Queen Problem

Uniform initialization

Scope is where something is inside of a block of code. Like i inside of a for loop.

If you have no idea how to make the declaration, the compiler figures it out. You can use it when you have alot of code
```c++
int a[]{1,2,3,4,5};

for(auto i:a) 
  cout << i << endl;

```

To change the value in an array we need to declare i as a reference.




## Dumb method
The dumb method works by using 8 for loops and looping through every number like an odometer. The for loop sets every index of the array as the number i as it increases. 

Then the ok function tests the array.
If it's true, then print the sequence by using a single for loop
Print the 8x8 board by using 2 for loops.

The ok function uses 2 for loops. The outer for loop goes through the array from the right to left (end to front).

The inner for loop goes through the numbers 0 to whatever index the outer array is at.

There is an if statement that checks if 
q[i] == q[c] if there is any conflicts in the row
or
(c - i) == abs(q[c] - q[i]) if there is any adjacent/diagonal conflicts


## Goto and Backtracking, 2d array
Create the 2d array for the chessboard
Begin by placing the Queen at the upper left most position q[0][0]

**goto statement new col:**
move to the next column
if the column reaches 8 then print the board
make row start at -1

**goto statement new row:**
more to next row (which will start at 0 at the beginning)
if row reaches 8 then backtrack because that means the queen couldn't reach a suitable position.

row test (if true then goto new row)
up diagonal test (if true then goto new row)
down diagonal test (if true then goto new row)

if you passed all the tests (meaning if all came false) then place a queen down in the current position. 

go to a new column

**goto statement backtrack:**
decrement column
if the column is less than 0 then return 0. end the program here because there is no more solutions.

For the previous column you have to find the position of the last queen and remove it.
make row = 0.
Use a while loop to find where the position is.
Then make that position of the queen = 0.
Then goto a new row.

**goto statement print:**
2 for loops to print the 2d array.
then goto backtrack to find more solutions.
