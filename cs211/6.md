# Structs
They are 99.9999% similar to classes.
```c++
Struct student{ // size of student = 8+8+8+4 = 28 OR 32 depending on your compiler
    string name; // size of string = 8
    string ID; // size of string = 8
    double GPA; // size of string = 8
    int year; // size of int = 4
}

student a[3]; // size of a = 96 (32 x 3)
```
To access the fields, we use the dot notation.

We can create an array of structs, for example, student a[3]; \
This creats an array of 3 different students. \
We can access the students like this:
```
a[0].name = "Jojo"
```



# Vectors

Vectors are similar to linked lists. They can grow dynamically.

Vectors have types. Here is how you declare them

```c++
vector <data_type> variable_name

vector <int> v1; // creates an empty vector

vector <int> v2(3); // creates a vector of size 3, all initialized to 0

vector <int> v3(3, 10); // creates a vector of size 3, all initialized to 10

vector <int> v3{1, 2, 3}; // creates a vector of size 2, that contains 1,2,3

vector <student> stu; // creates an empty vector
```

You can use these functions to do things to the vector

```c++
vector_name.push_back(value); //add element to end of vector
vector_name.pop_back(); // remove last element of vector
vector_name.back(); // returns last element of vector
```

More ways to initialize a vector
```c++
vector <int> v1 {1,2,3};

vector <int> v2 (v1); // v2 = {1,2,3}

int array[] {1,2,3,4,5};
int num_elements = sizeof(array)/sizeof(int); // (5 x 4) / 4 = 20 / 4 = 5
vector <int> v3(array, num_elements); // how does this work?

```

we can use a ranged based for loop \
we can pass a vector into a function
